# Description

The backend of this application is developed in Java using Spring Boot, while the frontend is built in React. The entire application is integrated with a database and accessible through a web interface. Users can perform CRUD operations on the UserList table, which contains user information and their tasks.
Half of the app was initially based on a YouTube project by Martyx, while the other half was developed independently by me.
